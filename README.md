**WebStationX** is a typescript 2D/3D video game engine based on WebGPU.   
The idea behind WebStationX is simple: provide a simple and pragmatic development kit from ui to rendering.  
Our priority is to eliminate black boxes and giving a maximum control to the user.  
Important note: This engine comes with a dozen diverse and varied examples.

## General features
- ðŸ‘¾ 2D - Sprite, animated tilemap
- ðŸ§Š 3D - Debug shapes, light, static mesh, animated mesh, material, sprite, billboard, skybox, walkmesh, multiple-camera, ray, nav-mesh, mover
- ðŸ’¥ VFX - Phong, normal-map, env-map
- ðŸŽ® Input - Action mapper for keyboard and gamepad
- ðŸš” Pathfinder - A* for 2D & 3D
- ðŸ“º Screen - Handle different screens of your game
- ðŸ“œ Scripts - Write game behaviors
- ðŸ”Š Sound - Sound manager built on the Web Audio API
- ðŸŒ³ Tree - Binary Space Partion for 2D & 3D
- ðŸŽ¨ UI - Component architecture very efficient to keep project clean and scalable

## Getting started
You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Once installation is done, let's build our first project.     

Clone this repo, go to the root of project and launch the build with the following command:
```
// you need to install dependencies
# npm install

// now, you can start with
# npm run dev
```

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The [WebStation Blender Exporter](https://github.com/jay19240/WebStationX-Blender-Exporter) allows you to export your models in compatible formats!

## Some parts taken from this work
- Use DOM for UI elements
- Use human readable custom format for all graphics stuff
- No physics engine, we assume if you need one there is many pretty lib for that like ammo.js or canon.js

## Platform
**Chrome Canary: 113+**  
**Edge Canary: 113+**

> *As WebGPU is not released, please enable `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu` or `edge://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`*
