**psx.ts** is like a bunch of micro-module of which becomes a powerful 2D/3D game engine specialized to build PSX Demake videogames.    

## General features
🧊 2D - Sprites, tilemaps
🧊 3D - Render pipelines, debug shapes, lights, meshes, materials, sprites, skybox and walkmeshs
🎮 Input - Action mapper for keyboard and gamepad
📺 Screen - Handle different screens of your game
📜 Scripts - Write game behaviors
🔊 Sound - Sound manager built on the Web Audio API
🎨 UI - Component architecture very efficient to keep project clean and scalable

## Getting started
You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Once installation is done, let's build our first project.     

Clone this repo, go to the root of project and launch the build with the following command:
```
// you need to install dependencies
# npm install

// now, you can start with
# npm run dev
```

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The [aliyah-blender-exporter](https://github.com/Anuban-corp/aliyah-blender-exporter) allows you to export your models in Aliyah compatible formats!
