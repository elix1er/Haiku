**WebStationX** is a typescript 2D/3D video game engine based on WebGPU. The idea is simple: provide a complete and coherent development kit from ui to rendering.
Against the current fashion, WebStationX use simple and pragmatic techniques, the goal here is to eliminate as many black boxes as possible, thus giving maximum control to the user.
Note: This project comes with a dozen diverse and varied examples.

## General features
- ðŸ§Š 2D - Sprites, tilemaps
- ðŸ§Š 3D - Debug shapes, point lights, directional light, meshes, materials, sprites, billboard, skybox, walkmeshs, multiple-camera, ray, nav-mesh, bsp
- ðŸ’¥ VFX - Phong, normal-map, env-map
- ðŸŽ® Input - Action mapper for keyboard and gamepad
- ðŸ“º Screen - Handle different screens of your game
- ðŸ“œ Scripts - Write game behaviors
- ðŸ”Š Sound - Sound manager built on the Web Audio API
- ðŸŽ¨ UI - Component architecture very efficient to keep project clean and scalable

## Getting started
You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Once installation is done, let's build our first project.     

Clone this repo, go to the root of project and launch the build with the following command:
```
// you need to install dependencies
# npm install

// now, you can start with
# npm run dev
```

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The [WebStation Blender Exporter](https://github.com/jay19240/WebStationX-Blender-Exporter) allows you to export your models in compatible formats!

## Contributions

4. Push to the Branch (git push origin new_feature)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Some parts taken from this work
- Use DOM for UI elements
- Use human readable custom format for all graphics stuff
- No physics engine, we assume if you need one there is many pretty lib for that like ammo.js or canon.js

## Platform
**Chrome Canary: 113+**  
**Edge Canary: 113+**

> *As WebGPU is not released, please enable `chrome://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu` or `edge://flags/#enable-unsafe-webgpu`*

## First todo-list
- Texture Scroll UV (for me)
- Texture Frames (JSM/JAM) (for me)
- Vertex Light (for me)
- Loader OBJ (for antoine)
- Textures Equirectangulaires (for antoine)
- Particules system (for antoine)

## Fun todo-list
- Transform a-star in a generic way (2D & 3D)
- Translate triple-triad demo (Work In Progress)
- Translate new demo from nft game (Work In Progress)
